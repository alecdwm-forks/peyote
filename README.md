# peyote
peyote is a mescaline remake, written in the Go programming language for better performance

Right now this is just a proof-of-concept prototype implementation, but it works nicely with the ZSH setup files from the [mescaline project](https://github.com/netzverweigerer/mescaline), with minor tweaking.
